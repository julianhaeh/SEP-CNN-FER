# SEP-CNN-FER

In this project we train a Convolutional Neural Network on a FER task from scratch. In order to accomplish this we explore different optimizations of the training pipeline and evaluate a variety of architectures. The final model is further analyzed using methods of Explainable AI, and presented in multiple demo scripts including a webcam demo.


How to Setup: 

    1. Setup a new virtual enviorment: 



    2. Install the project in editable mode (This allows us to import the files as all other pip modules):

        pip install -e .

    3. Install the dependencies:


    No Data needs to be downloaded in advance, as it is loaded from HuggingFace.
